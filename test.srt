一件有趣的事實：

18
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:16,560
維基百科顯示，平均每個人都和一千八百萬人分享同一個生日。

19
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:16,560
然而並沒有證據能夠證明，同一天出生的人之間存在著任何行為的相似性。

20
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,560
如果有....

21
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,560
那就是維基百科還沒發現而已。

39
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,770


40
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,110
好的 我準備好了
Okay, I'm ready.

41
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,650
你保證你會喜歡你的禮物的吧
You promise you like your gift?

42
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,720
這條毛巾嗎 不忍直視
The towel? It's absolutely terrible.

43
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,450
穿好衣服了嗎
Suit's on?

44
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,120
-一切就緒 夫人 -我指的是你的生日套裝
- Yes, ma'am. - Your birthday suit.

45
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,320
永遠都是這件
Only one I've got.

46
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,400
我不得不把內衣穿在外面
I had to put the lingerie on top of my clothes.

47
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,500
我注意到了
I see that.

48
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,270
這讓我感覺糟透了
It wasn't a great moment for me.

49
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,800
生日傳統就是傳統
Tradition is tradition.

50
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,570
好吧 但今年我想直接切入正題
Yeah. But I'm gonna go ahead

51
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,770
省掉火辣生日舞
and spare us both the seductive birthday dance

52
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,510
-的環節 -抱歉 寶貝 但是今天是我的生日
- this year. - I'm sorry, baby, but it's my birthday,

53
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,010
而我真的很想 很想 很想看那支舞
and I would really, really like to see the dance.

54
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,760
等死吧你
Your funeral.

55
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,590
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

56
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:24,990
-準備好了嗎 -嗯哼
- Ready? - Mm-hmm.

57
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,760
你喜歡這樣
You like it,

58
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,930
對嗎
right?

59
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:31,930
這就是你想要的對吧
This is what you want.

60
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:32,930
這樣來一點
A little of that.

61
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,640
再這樣來一點
A little of that, for you?

62
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,700
你就等著
I will gag

63
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:37,640
我用毛巾噎死你吧
you dead with that towel.

64
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,340
好了 好了
Okay, okay.

65
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,710
-我這就閉嘴 -求你了
- I'm quiet. - Come on.

66
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,560


67
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,970
你混蛋
You suck.

68
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,860
老闆 有空嗎
Got a sec, boss?

69
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,090
有啊 怎麼了
Yeah. What's up?

70
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,670
耶
Yeah...

71
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,610
-我們超愛你的節目的 -哈
- We love your show. - Huh?

72
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:54,850
你想一起來跳舞嗎
Do you want to dance?

73
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,980
額額 不想 但是 嗯
Uh-uh. No. But, um,

74
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,180
你們可以繼續
you know, you go ahead.

75
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,090
今天是我的生日
It's my birthday today.

76
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,390
我今天三十六了
36 today.

77
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,660
-你看起來一點都不像啊 -我超像
- You don't look 36. - Yeah, I do.

78
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,010
嘿 三個寶 你們仨知道
Hey, Big Three, do you three know

79
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,450
我有多愛你們媽媽嗎 我是說 你們真的
how much I love your mother? I mean, do you even have

80
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,290
-知道嗎 -我們當然 現在趕緊閉嘴
- any idea? - Yeah, we do. Now shut up

81
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,990
-放你的大屁股老婆去睡覺好嗎 -不行
- and let your fat-ass wife go to sleep. - No.

82
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,490
不 不 生日傳統就是傳統
No, no, no. Birthday tradition is birthday tradition.

83
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,690
孩子們 閉上你們的小眼睛 因為爸爸要對媽咪
So close your eyes in there, kids, because Daddy's about

84
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,870
做一些非常羞羞的事情
to do some real terrible things to Mommy.

85
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,600
你怎麼會對一個大腹便便的孕婦有性趣
How could you possibly want me right now?

86
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,730
無論何時 我的妻子 你都讓我燃起慾火
In any state, my wife, you arouse me.

87
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,230
我保證我會澆滅它的
I bet I can make that go away.

88
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:22,840
-你澆不滅的 -我的羊水破了
- There's nothing you can say that's... - My water just broke.

89
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,410
-你做到了 -沒錯
- Yep. - Yeah.

90
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,750
我是在一九八六年的時候發現一切開始偏離正軌的
You know when I think it all went wrong for me was 1986,

91
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,850
那時候我才二年級 他們正準備把挑戰者號送進太空
second grade. They were sending the Challenger up into space.

92
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,120
你們記得挑戰者號 對嗎
You remember the Challenger, right?

93
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,850
-記得 和桑德拉·布洛克一起的 -不
- Yeah. With Sandra Bullock? - No.

94
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,960
是克麗斯塔·麥克利夫對嗎  她當時正要
Christa McAuliffe, right? She was gonna be

95
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,320
成為第一位登上太空的老師
the first teacher into space.

96
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,360
她差點就改變世界了
She was actually gonna change the world.

97
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,530
我雖然對這些事情一竅不通 但是你能感覺到對嗎
I don't know how, but you could feel that, you know?

98
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,430
至少 在二年級的時候 你可以感覺到
At least, in second grade, you could... you could feel it.

99
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,700
那天中午在學校
Middle of the school day,

100
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,470
那個老師出現在電視機裏 對嗎
the teacher brings in a TV, right?

101
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,100
我們全部都坐在那兒 看著現場直播
We're all just sitting there, watching the launch,

102
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,170
一大堆七年級在那 只是看著
a bunch of seven-year-olds just-just watchin'.

103
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,870
然後突然之間 彭
And all of a sudden, boom!

104
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,810
所有的東西都炸飛了
The whole thing explodes.

105
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,980
小老師克麗斯塔·麥考利夫的碎片
Little pieces of sweet Christa McAuliffe

106
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,210
像雨一樣落在弗洛裏達州的大地上
come raining down all over the state of Florida.

107
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,650
太讓人悲傷了
It was awful.

108
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,490
也許就是在那個時候 我意識到改變世界的最終
Maybe that's when I realized trying to change the world

109
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,820
結果只能是把自己炸成
just leads to being blown up

110
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,760
弗洛裏達州上空漂浮著的小碎片
into little pieces all over Florida.

111
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,400
可能這就是我淪為到演《奶爸》的原因
Maybe that's how I wound up as the Man-ny.

112
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,970
是我姐
It's my sister.

113
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,940
凱特
Kate?

114
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,150
我沒找到冰塊 所以
You... you didn't have any ice, so...

115
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,880
好吧 最糟的時刻
Well, this is a low point.

116
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,190
咱們三十六歲了
We're 36.

117
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,030
我們正式步入三十歲的後期了
We're officially late 30s.

118
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,630
像是 被甩在三十歲的尾巴上了
Like, we are deep in the threes.

119
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,530
沒錯
Yep.

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,540
我們怎麼到這一步的
How did I get here?

121
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,370
我他媽到底怎麼變成現在這個樣子的
Like, how the hell did I get here?

122
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,540
還記二年級的時候 挑戰者號爆炸事件嗎
Remember second grade, the Challenger explosion?

123
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:07,740
別再提那件事了
You have got to stop with the Challenger explosion.

124
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,280
那是一個轉折點
There's something there.

125
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,980
你是我人生裏唯一的好事 凱文
You're the only good thing in my life, Kev.

126
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,950
-少來了 我才沒有那麼好  -我知道
-I'm not that great. Come on. -I know.

127
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,590
這讓我的生活更顯得糟糕
That's what makes it worse.

128
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,220
我曾經有過
I had this...

129
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:28,130
對自己人生的夢想
whole dream life that I envisioned for myself.

130
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,570
有一份真正的事業
A real career.

131
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,070
嫁一個像老爸那樣的男人
I would marry a man like Dad.

132
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,400
成為像老媽一樣的女人
I would be a mom like Mom.

133
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,940
但是看看我 凱文
But look at me, Kev.

134
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:45,610
我把我的夢想吃沒了
Like, I ate my dream life away.

135
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:48,450
所以 你想我對你說什麼呢
So what do you... what do you want me to say to you, huh?

136
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,020
姐 有沒有那種能讓你感到安慰的
Wh-What... Give me the magic phrase, sis, to say

137
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,920
魔咒 如果有我一定會說出來
to make you feel better and I'll say it.

138
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,760
我也不知道 你可以告訴我別再自怨自艾了
Tell me to quit feeling sorry for myself. I don't know.

139
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,710
或者是叫我別做夢了
Tell me to wake the hell up.

140
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:59,530
叫我下狠心去減肥
Tell me, tell me to lose the damn weight.

141
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,730
別再自怨自艾了
Quit feeling sorry for yourself.

142
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,100
好嗎 就從現在開始 從你的白日夢裏醒過來
All right? That can start right now. Wake the hell up.

143
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,800
還有 你知道的
And-and, you know...

144
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,300
呃 第三件 第三件事情是什麼來著
the... What was the... what was the third thing?

145
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,670
減掉這該死的肥
Lose the damn weight.

146
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,110
你想再說一遍嗎
You want to say that again?

147
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,780
我會減掉這該死的肥的
I'm gonna lose the damn weight.

148
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,590
你比你看起來聰明多了
You are a lot smarter than you look.

149
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,790
邁克爾·貝也是這麼說我的
That's what Michael Bay told me.

150
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:42,070
-就是這樣 -噢 耶
- Here you go. - Oh, yeah.

151
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,970
謝謝你
Thank you.

152
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,970
嘿 不知道你意識到沒有 孩子們和我
Hey, do you realize me and the kids

153
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:49,410
-可以同一天過生日了 -我知道
- are gonna have the same birthday? - I know.

154
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,780
耶
Yeah.

155
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,680
提前了六周
Still, six weeks early

156
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,280
-還是太早了 -沒錯
- is pretty early. - Yeah.

157
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,250
我知道
I know.

158
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:08,090
這玩意兒到底是怎麼用的
What the hell could this thing possibly be for?

159
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,700
這是用來做肛門檢查的
It's for rectal examinations.

160
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,700
你拿的是用過的
That one's from the dirty pile.

161
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,300
不好意思
Sorry.

162
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,540
請容我自我介紹 我是可塔斯基醫生
Now, then, I'm Dr. Katowski,

163
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:21,710
但是你也可以叫我醫生或是K醫生
but you can call me Doc or Dr. K,

164
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,210
大家通常都是這麼叫我的
which is what most people choose to do

165
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,410
-因為這樣叫比較隨意 -噢
- because it's folksy. - Oh,

166
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:27,780
你是和施耐德醫生一起工作嗎
so you work with Dr. Schneider?

167
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,620
呼一口氣 親愛的
Take a breath for me, dear.

168
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,090
現在 做深呼吸
Deep breath, now.

169
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,920
幹得好
There you go.

170
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,790
好了 覺得輕鬆點了嗎 很好 很好
All right. You relaxed? Good, good, good.

171
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,330
施耐德醫生的爛尾一個小時之前
Dr. Schneider's appendix burst

172
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,400
破裂了 他剛剛被推進手術室 不 不
an hour ago. He just went into surgery. -No, no,

173
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,080
別慌 別慌 看著我
no, no, no. Now, stay with me.

174
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,800
噢 上帝啊 不 我需要施耐德醫生
Oh, God. No, I need Dr. Schneider

175
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,400
-因為他知道我 -看著我
- 'cause he knows about... - Stay with me now.

176
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:49,170
在施耐德痛苦掙扎的間隙
Between his screams of agony, Schneider

177
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,440
他向我詳細說明了你的情況
brought me up to speed on everything concerning your case.

178
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,540
我對三胞胎瞭如指掌 並且也知道
I know all about these triplets, and I know that this

179
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,580
-這是一次風險極高的分娩 -沒錯
- is a high-risk pregnancy. - Yeah.

180
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,010
但是一切都會沒事的
But everything's gonna be all right.

181
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,910
你們是在開玩笑
This is some kind of bad joke,

182
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,920
-對吧 -不好意思 這是事實
-right? -It is not, unfortunately.

183
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:06,720
現在 親愛的 我要直接打消你最大的擔憂
Now, sweetheart, I'm gonna get straight to your first concern.

184
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,620
看著我 看著我
Look at me now. Look at me.

185
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,060
-你看見我了嗎 一個七十三歲的老頭 -沒錯
- Do you see me? I am 73 years old. - Yeah.

186
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,590
-你知道這意味著什麼嗎 -不懂
- You know what that means, don't you? - No.

187
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:18,870
這意味著我不會像以前一樣火急火燎
That means I don't run wind sprints as fast as I used to,

188
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,770
但我的能力卻依舊老道熟練
but my faculties are otherwise completely intact.

189
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,370
我也曾希望我自己今不如昔
There are days that I wish they weren't,

190
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,580
那樣我就能愉快地享受退休生活 把餘生浪費在比
because then I would retire and spend my remaining days

191
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,080
將一個八磅重的物體從女人的陰道裏拉出來
doing something more glamorous than pulling eight-pound objects

192
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,650
更有吸引力的事情上
out of women's vaginas.

193
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,310
但是直到現在
But until that time,

194
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,550
我依舊每天到這裏報道
I keep showing up here every day.

195
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,620
好了
All right?

196
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:41,960
我也意識到 於你而言我完全是一個陌生人
I'm also aware that I'm a complete stranger to you,

197
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,590
而此刻是你人生最重要
and this is the biggest moment

198
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,590
-的一刻 -沒錯
- of your life. - Yeah.

199
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:50,100
-好了 親愛的 聽我說 -好的
- All right? Honey, listen to me, - Yeah.

200
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,600
我是萬里挑一的醫生
I am the best of the best.

201
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:56,000
而我以我子孫後代的生命
And I swear to you, on the lives of my children

202
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,010
向你擔保 我一定能夠勝任
and my grandchildren, that I am up to the task.

203
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,940
-好嗎 -好的
- All right? All right. - Okay.

204
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,180
-謝謝你 -沒事的
- Thank you. - All right.

205
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,850
很好
Good.

206
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,010
現在 告訴我你們誰懷孕了
Now, which one of you's pregnant?

207
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,350
哈哈 這才是一個冷笑話 但是
Now, that was a bad joke, but

208
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,820
你需要繼續做深呼吸
you just continue to take those deep breaths...

209
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,990
讓我們看看 我的人是不是在周圍
Let's see... let me see if any of my people are here.

210
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,430
讓我們做一個小測試
Let me take a little test. Sheket bevakasha!

211
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,460
猶太人 猶太人
Jew! Jew!

212
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,630
猶太人
Jew!

213
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,170
好了 嘿 拜託
All right, hey! Come on!

214
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,440
現在 開始
And... action!

215
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,970
哈 哈
Huh? Huh?

216
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,380
你想讓我做些什麼來取悅你 哈
What can I do to make you feel better, huh?

217
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,980
需要我給你餵奶 來讓你感覺好點嗎
You want me to breastfeed you? Would that make you feel better,

218
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:38,980
要我給你餵奶嗎
if I breastfed ya?

219
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,720
沒錯是嗎 好的 來試試
Yeah? Here we go. Let's try to...

220
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,590
對不起 夥計們 我需要停一下 呃
I'm-I'm sorry, guys. I need to cut. Uh...

221
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,160
抱歉 大傢伙兒 一點技術上的小問題
Sorry, everybody. A little technical difficulty.

222
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,900
誰想要T恤
Who wants a T-shirt?

223
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,570
-嘿 夥計 -怎麼了
- Hey, man. - What's up?

224
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,070
我很抱歉 我還不太懂我的角色
I'm sorry. You know, I'm trying to understand, for my character,

225
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,070
我們難道是在表示
you know, um, are-are we suggesting, you know,

226
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:08,240
奶爸覺得一個成年男子可以給嬰兒餵奶嗎
that the Man-ny thinks a grown man can breastfeed a baby?

227
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,200
我們是想說明奶爸腦子有問題嗎
Are we saying the Man-ny's got brain damage?

228
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,340
因為我可以說點話
'Cause I could do a voice.

229
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,660
凱文 我知道你在意 你在意這個角色
Kevin, I know you care. I know you care about the character.

230
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,010
謝謝你 我確實很在意這個角色
I do care about the character. Thank you.

231
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,250
我還知道你是個三十好幾的男演員
I also know that you're a 30-something-year-old actor

232
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,090
最好的成績也不過是在《音樂之鄉》裏面露了三集臉而已
whose biggest previous role was a three-episode arc on Nashville.

233
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,790
所以你最好按照劇本演 或者趕緊滾蛋
So say the line or find another job.

234
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,430
因為相信我 你從這回到車上的這點時間裏
Because trust me when I say that I'll have you replaced

235
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,430
我就能讓瑞恩·高斯林 瑞恩·菲利普斯
by Ryan Gosling, Ryan Phillippe, or Ryan Reynolds

236
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:30,100
瑞恩·雷諾茲 或者瑞恩·不管誰 分分鐘替掉你
or any other handsome Ryan by the time you get to your car.

237
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:33,230
相信我 我的收視會提高的
And believe me, my ratings will go up.

238
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,670
瑞恩·高斯林才不用來演這些垃圾
Ryan Gosling would never do this crap.

239
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,040
你是對的 凱文
You are right, Kevin.

240
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:41,210
瑞恩·高斯林絕對不會來演這些垃圾
Ryan Gosling would never do this crap.

241
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,180
記住這句話
Remember that.

242
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,150
拜託你 安妮
Come on, Annie!

243
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,680
快去搶那個球啊 甜心
Go get the ball, hon!

244
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,260
嘿 老爸
Hi, Daddy!

245
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,590
嘿 親愛的 球在那兒呢
Hi, sweetheart! There's the ball!

246
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,060
你想去踢足球嗎
You want to play soccer?

247
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,890
-這 -她踢得怎麼樣
- It... - How's she doing?

248
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,900
我覺得她正在為下半場養精蓄銳呢
Uh, I think she's saving it for the second half.

249
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,560
她怎麼樣
How's about her?

250
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:09,340
-四個男孩被弄哭了 這個數量還在上升 -這才是我的小假小子
- Four boys crying and counting. - That's my little bull dyke.

251
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,710
-交換 -交換
- Switch? - Switch.

252
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:16,610
-那是 -法式辮子嗎 是的
- Is that a... Aw. - French braid. Yes.

253
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,750
穿上去 穿下去再穿過來 寶貝
Over, under, back through, baby!

254
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,220
-嘿 媽咪 -很好 至少 她交到朋友
- Hi, Mommy! - All right, well, she made a friend.

255
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,150
我找到他了
I found him.

256
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,790
我的父親
My father.

257
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,760
什麼 什麼時候
What? When?

258
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,160
我雇了一個人
I, uh... I hired a guy.

259
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,190
花了將近一千五百元
It cost about 1,500 bucks.

260
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,830
現在 你會發現我用證券的形式付給他
Now, I paid for it on the Amex. You're gonna see it.

261
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,410
是私人證券 不是商業的那種 我知道
It's the personal Amex, not the business Amex. I know,

262
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:41,130
-我才不在乎那些證券 -我知道
- I don't care about the Amex. - I know.

263
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,340
所以你要
So you're gonna...

264
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,770
-沒門 -為什麼
- No. - Why not?

265
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,110
因為我媽是一個難產而死的癮君子
Because she was a crack addict who died during childbirth,

266
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,310
而我爸把我扔在消防局門口
and he was the guy who left me at a fire station,

267
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,150
很可能是因為他想不到任何其他的好地方
probably because he couldn't think of anything more cliche.

268
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,950
那你還找他幹嘛
So why'd you find him?

269
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,880
我也不知道 貝絲
I don't know, Beth.

270
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,250
我真的不知道
I really don't know.

271
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,060
噢 加油
Oh! Go!

272
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,160
幹得漂亮 泰絲
Way to go, Tess!

273
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,960
別忘了運動精神 寶貝
Sportsmanship, baby!

274
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,660
抱歉
Excuse me.

275
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,230
你介意嗎
Do you mind?

276
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,890
然後我就和我自己說 坦尼亞
...and so, I said to myself, "Tanya,

277
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,210
你已經做了所有你該做的了
"You have done what you have set out to do.

278
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,040
你減掉了體重
"You have lost the weight.

279
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,780
現在你可以幫別人變成像你一樣的瘦子了
And now you can help others be skinny like you."

280
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,320
所以 誰想來分享他的故事
So, who would like to share first?

281
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,820
每次我準備節食的時候
Every time I'm going on a diet,

282
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,620
他都會來阻止我
he sabotages me.

283
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,060
我丈夫一次又一次在半夜抓住我
Well, my husband found me eating out of the fridge

284
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,730
在冰箱外面偷吃食物
in the middle of the night again the other night.

285
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,130
我在努力
I'm trying.

286
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,970
我不是阻止你 瑪莎
I'm not sabotaging you, Marsha.

287
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,900
我知道我的問題和在座的各位都不一樣
I know I don't have the same issues as everyone here.

288
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,340
但是你們完全不知道 像我這樣的人
But you guys don't know what it's like looking like me

289
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,710
每天帶著上半身多出來的八磅肉是什麼感受
and carrying around that extra seven pounds in your midsection.

290
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,020
對於我來說
For me,

291
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,120
最大的病因就是我媽
it was my mom.

292
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,750
她以前從來不讓我們吃披薩
She never let us eat pizza.

293
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:36,690
所以現在 每次我看見披薩
And so now, every time I see a pizza,

294
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,530
我都一定要把它們都吃完
I mean, I have to eat the entire thing.

295
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,700
如果再這樣下去的話 我可能
If this doesn't work, I might just

296
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,780
就要把我的胃釘起來封住然後
have my stomach stapled and just be done with...

297
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:51,740
對不起 各位
I am sor... I'm sorry.

298
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,080
我只是 只是在想像訂書針
I was just... I was picturing the stapler.

299
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,710
真的是
And it's...

300
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,050
太不合適了
which is totally inappropriate.

301
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,980
我抱歉
I apologize.

302
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,450
如果有幫助的話 我得說
I'm way fatter than you if it...

303
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:04,720
我比你可胖多了
means anything.

304
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,130
嗯 咖啡
Mmm, coffee.

305
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:18,030
嗨
Hi.

306
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:22,640
天 這些人討厭我
Boy, these people hate me.

307
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,410
你有點越界了
You kind of crossed the line.

308
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,810
沒錯 你也笑了
Yeah, you laughed.

309
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,840
-因為我是為跨界而生的啊  -噢
- That's because I live across the line. - Oh!

310
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,180
好吧
Okay.

311
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,450
托比
Toby.

312
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,820
凱特
Kate.

313
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,080
沒錯
Yeah.

314
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,520
很高興見到你
Nice to meet you.

315
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,750
所以 你想要一起當胖友嗎
So, you want to be fat friends?

316
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,960
當然
Sure.

317
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:45,060
-但是我一定會減肥成功的 -你知道的
- But I'm gonna lose the weight. - You know,

318
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,730
我大概會失敗
I'm probably not.

319
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,660
好吧
Okay.

320
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,670
我現在不能和胖子談戀愛
I can't fall for a fat person right now.

321
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,210
好吧
Well...

322
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,610
那我也去減肥好了
I guess I'll lose the weight then.

323
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,780
呼吸 貝卡 呼吸  呼吸 呼吸
Breathe, Bec. Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe.

324
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,720
呼吸 呼吸
Breathe. Breathe.

325
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,150
深呼吸 貝卡
Deep breath, Bec.

326
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,490
深吸一口氣 呼出來
Deep breath, deep breath.

327
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,960
深呼吸 看著我 深呼吸
Deep breathe, look at me, deep breathe.

328
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,330
幹得好
There you go.

329
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,830
非常好 快完了 快好了
There you go, almost done, almost done.

330
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,830
深呼吸 嘿 幹得很好
There you go. Hey, there you go.

331
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,840
寶貝 我要為我接下來兩個小時內說的話提前向你道歉
Baby, I'm sorry for anything I'm gonna say in the next two hours.

332
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,440
我不是有意的
I mean none of it.

333
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,840
-有些話你肯定是故意的 -隻有一小部分
- You're gonna mean some of it. - Very little of it.

334
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:32,570
好吧
Fair enough.

335
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,680
我幾乎為施耐德的闌尾破裂了感到有點高興了
I'm almost glad Schneider's appendix burst.

336
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:35,940
我挺喜歡你們倆的
I like you two.

337
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,510
鑒於我剛認識你們倆
Now since I'm new here,

338
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,310
在事情變得更緊張前
I thought we might have a conversation now

339
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,420
我覺得我們應該要聊聊
before things get more intense.

340
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,550
嗯 這是個好主意
Yeah, that sounds nice.

341
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,120
你要聊你的孫子嗎
So, you said you have grandchildren?

342
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,790
不是聊這些
Not that kind of conversation.

343
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,720
我知道施耐德醫生
Now. I know that Dr.

344
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,390
跟你們聊過關於胎位的問題
Schneider talked to you about the positioning of the babies,

345
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,730
也預先告知了接生的困難
and how complicated this delivery could get.

346
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,490
我覺得我們應該
I thought we should...

347
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,460
不好意思 我們不想進行這方面的談話
I'm sorry, no, we're not gonna have this conversation.

348
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,590
傑克 我們需要談一談這方面的
- Jack, we need to have this...

349
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,870
我們不會就這個話題繼續聊下去
- We're not having this conversation

350
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,140
-因為這樣的問題不會出現 -但是我們需要談
- because it's not gonna happen. - Well, we need to talk about...

351
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,600
我將會帶著三個健康的寶寶
We are walking out of this hospital with

352
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,570
和我妻子一起平安出院
three healthy babies and one healthy wife.

353
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:06,140
-當然 但是我們還是 -我們已經特地
- Absolutely, but we still... - I have three cribs

354
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:09,580
在我們的新家裝好了三個新搖籃
at our new home that we bought specifically

355
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:12,080
-我們的三個孩子會在那兒長大 -我知道
- for our three children to grow up in. - I understand.

356
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,370
我媽媽已經織好了三件嬰兒連體衣
My-my mother, my mother has already knitted three onesies.

357
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,120
我知道
I know.

358
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:18,220
儘管她在這方面沒什麼天賦 織得很慢
And she's a slow, no-talent knitter.

359
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,990
而且今天恰好是我的生日
It's also happens to be my birthday today, which tends to be

360
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,460
也會是我們家的大喜日子 會是我的幸運日
a pretty great day in our house, a day when I get pretty lucky.

361
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,330
所以我需要在場所有的人都相信我
So I'm gonna need everyone in this room to believe me

362
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,430
相信今天這裏只會有好事發生
when I say that only good things are gonna happen here today.

363
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,970
事實上
Actually...

364
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,070
我不僅僅只是想要你們相信
I-I don't just want you to believe it.

365
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:39,840
我是要你們都知道就是如此
I want you to know it.

366
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,410
你知道了嗎 寶貝
Do you know it, baby?

367
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,950
我愛你
I love you.

368
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,680
嗯 我知道的
Yeah, I know it.

369
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,820
我知道的
I know it.

370
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,890
那你知道了嗎 醫生
Do you know it, Doc?

371
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,290
我知道我蠻喜歡你的
I know I like you.

372
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:01,430
那就這樣吧 努力讓好事發生
Let's just start there, get you what you want.

373
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:05,130
好的
Okay.

374
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:11,940
嘿 幫我把下午空出來吧
Hey, clear my afternoon?

375
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,300
但是先生 那個
But sir, what about...?

376
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,100
謝謝
Thanks.

377
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,660
來了來了
Yeah, yeah.

378
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,430
別敲啦 我一開始就聽到
Stop all that banging, I heard you the first time,

379
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,660
你敲門了
banging on the door.

380
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,270
是誰啊
Who the hell is...

381
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,100
我是蘭德爾·皮斯 我是你的親生兒子
My name is Randall Peasing. I'm your biological son.

382
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,770
三十六年前你在前門拋下我
36 years ago you left me at the front door...

383
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,010
等等 讓我先說完
No, hold on, just let me say this.

384
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,710
三十六年前你在一個消防局的前門拋下我
36 years ago you left me at the front door of a fire station.

385
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,950
你別擔心 我不是因為想要你的財產什麼的
Now, don't worry, I'm not here

386
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,110
才過來找你的
because I want anything from you.

387
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:54,750
我的養父母無與倫比
I was raised by two incredible parents,

388
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,750
我擁有一個溫馨的家庭 還有
I have a lights out family of my own, and...

389
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,250
你看到那部停在你家前面的車了嗎
that car you see parked out in front of your house?

390
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:03,920
那部車售價十四萬三千美金 直接付的現金全款
Cost $143,000 and I bought it for cash.

391
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,930
我這麼做是因為我任性
I bought it for cash because I felt like it,

392
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,030
更因為我有錢
and because I can do stuff like that.

393
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,400
嗯 你看 我現在過得特別好
Yeah, you see, I turned out pretty all right.

394
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,100
這可能會讓大家難以置信
Which might surprise a lot of folks

395
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,140
因為三十六年前
considering the fact that 36 years ago

396
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,440
我的人生始於被你遺棄在消防局門階上
my life started with you leaving me on a fire station doorstep

397
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,540
我除了一張破毯子和髒尿布
with nothing more than a ratty blanket

398
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,880
之外一無所有
and a crap-filled diaper.

399
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:28,320
我今天特意過來是為了跟你面對面
I came here today so I could look you in the eye,

400
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:31,720
親口把剛剛這些話說給你聽 然後回到我的豪華轎車
say that to you, and then get back in my fancy-ass car

401
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,590
是為了向我自己證明 向你證明
and finally prove to myself, and to you,

402
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,920
向愛我的家庭證明
and to my family who loves me,

403
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,430
即使我知道了你是我的親生父親
that I didn't need a thing from you,

404
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,660
我也不需要你給我任何東西
even after I knew who you were.

405
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,330
-你想進來坐坐嗎 -好的
- You want to come in? - Okay.

406
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,860
你有什麼想要跟我說的嗎
So is there something you want to say to me?

407
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,860
不然的話 我還有事要忙
'Cause otherwise, I really need to get going.

408
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,530
你想要我說什麼嗎
You want me to say something?

409
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:02,330
不 我跟你說了 我不需要你的任何東西
No, I told you, I don't want anything from you.

410
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:04,430
-但你來了 -隻是為了跟你說剛剛那番話
- But you're here. - Just to tell you that.

411
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,340
好吧
Well...

412
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,610
我知道了
I've been told.

413
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,680
你知道嗎 如果你只是想坐在這裏找借口辯解
You know what? If you're just gonna sit here making excuses...

414
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,140
-我沒有想找借口 -因為你沒什麼借口可找的
- Didn't make any excuses. - Because there's nothing you can say.

415
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,510
我沒有想為當年遺棄你而找什麼借口
Didn't say anything for just that reason.

416
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:24,820
看起來你像是想要我努力去彌補當年的過錯 這樣你就
Seems to me you want me to try to make amends so you can say,

417
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,320
-可以對我說「去你的」 然後摔門而去 -真是可笑
- "Screw you," And storm out of here. - That's ridiculous.

418
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,690
好吧
Okay.

419
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:37,790
我也希望能說 我還記得那天 但是
I'd like to say I remember that day, but...

420
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,190
我不記得了
I barely do.

421
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,800
我現在戒了毒了 但當時
I'm clean now, finally, but...

422
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:45,130
我是個街頭癮君子
I was on the streets then.

423
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:49,200
我還記得你母親臨終的時候
I remember her dying,

424
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,140
還記得那個小嬰兒
your mom, remember the baby.

425
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:58,480
我也想說我記得我把你拋棄在了消防局
I'd like to say I remember leaving you at a fire station,

426
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,950
但是我並不記得
but I don't.

427
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,550
這不是借口
Not an excuse.

428
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,950
事實上 這還說明了一些我自己都不記得的
In fact, it probably tells you something about me

429
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,690
自己的過往了
that I don't remember.

430
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,660
我是挺喜歡消防局的
I do like fire stations, though,

431
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,660
所以如果我非要做這種事的話
so that sounds like something I'd do

432
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,000
我是很有可能選擇去消防局
if I had to do something, you know?

433
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,640
我不知道這是不是你想聽到的
Anyway, I don't know if that's what you're looking for,

434
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,440
但不管怎麼樣 你可以放心
but either way, you can be sure

435
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,110
我經歷的一切已經讓我遭受了
this life of mine is punishment enough

436
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,710
足夠的懲罰
for the things I've done.

437
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,310
-如果你覺得我會原諒你 -我不覺得
- If you think I'm gonna forgive you... - I don't.

438
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,950
不 你是對的 我不過是想
No, you were right. I did just want

439
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,380
說一句「去你的」 然後摔門離去
to say, "Screw you," And storm out of here.

440
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,420
-嗯 繼續 -去你的
- Well, go ahead. - Screw you.

441
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:36,820
嗯
Yup.

442
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,530
你想要看看你的孫女們嗎
You want to meet your grandchildren?

443
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,870
等我拿一下外套
I'll get my coat.

444
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,000
嗨 小朋友
Hey, kid.

445
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,000
嘿 艾倫
Hey. Alan.

446
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,510
嘿 謝謝你幫我啊朋友
All right. Hey, thanks for doing this, man.

447
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,910
-噢 -我真的很感謝
- Oh. - I really appreciate it.

448
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,580
哎呀 不用那麼客氣啦
Oh, please. No thanks necessary.

449
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:05,280
他們付了我一大筆錢
they're paying me an absolute fortune.

450
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,620
當然了
I'm sure.

451
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,180
順便一提 你的那場戲不錯哦
Great scene for you, by the way.

452
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,350
-你看了？ -是呀
- You know? - Yeah.

453
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:11,350
跟你說吧 那混蛋用心寫的話還是能寫出點東西的
Tell ya what, when the prick wants to, he can actually write.

454
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,160
是的 那麼
Yeah. Well,

455
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,660
場上見吧
I'll see you out there on the playing field.

456
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:16,260
-是呀 -祝你好運吧 孩子
- All right. - Break a leg, kid.

457
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:17,590
謝謝你哦 先生
Thank you, sir.

458
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,200
嗨
Hey!

459
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:23,970
女士們 先生們 有請我們的艾倫·錫克
Ladies and gentlemen, the great Alan Thicke!

460
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,340
預備 開始
And... action.

461
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,490
噢 老天啊
Oh, for God's sake, I'm

462
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,670
我只是想要緩和一下氣氛
just trying to lighten up the situation here.

463
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,110
不 我知道了 那就是你的作風 對嗎
No, I get it. That's what you do, right?

464
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,140
我詼諧有趣的父親
My lightweight dad.

465
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,540
-兒子 -別叫我「兒子」
- Son... - Don't call me "Son."

466
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,550
你走吧 去做你自己的事 走人吧
Just go. Just do your thing, get out of here.

467
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,150
-拜託了 兒子 -我說了你不要叫我「兒子」
- Come on, son... - I said don't call me "Son."

468
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:44,290
當我看著那個小女孩 我願意為她做任何事情
I-I look at that little girl, I would do anything for her.

469
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,820
你明白嗎？如果有部火車向她開過來
You understand? Y-You show me a train,

470
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,890
我會毫不猶豫地上前幫她擋住
I'll jump in front of it for her, no question.

471
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,890
儘管她不是我的女兒
And she's not even mine.

472
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:53,660
我的意思是 這三十年來
I mean, you... you mosey in and out of my life

473
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,760
你就這樣隨意地走入又走出我的生命
the past 30 years like the way you have, I...

474
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,830
我不懂你為什麼這樣做 我從來都不懂你
I don't understand that and I'll never understand you,

475
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,300
所以你還是趕緊滾蛋吧
so just get the hell out of here.

476
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,370
趕緊走吧
Just get out.

477
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,780
我要你趕緊滾蛋
I want you to get out and this time,

478
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,480
並且再也不要干涉我的人生 懂了嗎
I want you to stay the hell out of my life, okay?

479
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,510
-兒子 -滾
- Son... - Leave!

480
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,560
停
And cut!

481
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,400
謝謝大家
Thank you.

482
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,640
太好了 他們認可我們
All right, they must think we did it.

483
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,770
-你做到了 -謝謝你
- You did it. - Thank you.

484
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:38,040
你太棒了 你震撼了全場
You were fa... you killed.

485
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,410
-謝謝你的參與 -太棒了
- Thank you for being here. - Excellent.

486
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,880
嘿 請問可以給我那個信封嗎
Hey, may I have the envelope, please?

487
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,480
噢 拜託
Oh, come on.

488
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,810
嗨你在幹嘛呢 快過來
There, what are you doing, come on, get in here.

489
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,950
你看 我跟你說了吧
See, I told you, right? I told you!

490
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,050
這真是太棒了 凱文
That's so good, Kevin.

491
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,050
-噢 -這感覺太棒了
- Oh... - That felt good.

492
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,150
現在我們只需要
Now all we need to do is just

493
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,390
把另一個版本快速過一遍
take a quick whack at the alt pass, huh?

494
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,790
噢 拜託 我們不需要另一個版本了
Oh, come on, we don't need an alt pass,

495
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,790
你在說什麼呢 你為什麼
what are you talking about? Why would you...

496
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,820
什麼 為什麼
wh-wh-what, for what?

497
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,790
凱文 拜託了 我們談過這個的
Kevin, come on, we talked about this.

498
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:58,430
你知道的吧 我特別喜歡這個版本 這個是我寫的你知道吧
You know? I loved it... I-I wrote it, you know?

499
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:02,060
但是 我們還是需要 需要一個稍加粉飾的版本
But, um, we just got to, we got to get a lighter version.

500
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,570
來吧
Come on.

501
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,430
我們來演一下另一個版本
Let's get that alt.

502
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,840
就當是為了我吧 可以嗎
For me, okay?

503
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,770
呃 還有 脫掉你的T恤
And, uh, lose the shirt.

504
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,710
脫掉效果會好一點
It's just better without the shirt.

505
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,510
希望大家都已經餓了
: I hope you're hungry,

506
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,810
因為我們給你們準備了披薩
'cause we got some pizza for you!

507
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:23,390
所有人都愛吃披薩
Everybody loves pizza!

508
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:33,400
好吧
All right,

509
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,210
不 這沒事的 大家不用驚慌
No, it's okay. No, no. Nobody be alarmed.

510
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,780
大家不用驚慌 這只是個假嬰兒
Nobody be alarmed, this isn't a real baby.

511
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:49,810
這個嬰兒什麼都感覺不到
This baby can't feel a thing,

512
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:51,710
因為所有事情都是假的
because everything's fake!

513
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,220
在這齣戲裏動真感情會被天打雷劈
God forbid we have real emotion in this show.

514
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,720
我們到底這有什麼
What do we got here?

515
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,920
我們有一個真正的行李箱
We got a real suitcase.

516
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:58,590
終於 我們有些真實的東西了
Finally, we got something real.

517
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,390
噢 不 看來不是的 你們看
Oh, no, we don't! Look,

518
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,460
行李箱裏空空如也
there's nothing in the suitcase!

519
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:04,590
你他媽要去哪呢 艾倫·錫克
Where the hell are you going, Alan Thicke?!

520
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,800
你他媽去到那兒之後
And what the hell are you gonna wear,

521
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,900
準備穿什麼啊 哈？
when you get there?! Huh?

522
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:10,570
這個行李箱裏他一件衣服都沒有
He's got no clothes in the suitcase!

523
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,900
你們知道是怎麼一回事嗎 我開始思考
You know what it is, I'm starting to think

524
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:12,990
現在是什麼情況 事實上
about things now. It's actually...

525
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,100
凱西 這不是你的錯 哥們
Casey, it's not your fault, brother.

526
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,300
這個節目那麼糟糕並不是編劇的錯
It's not the writer's fault this show is so bad.

527
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:19,410
而且還是糟糕得離譜
And it's so bad!

528
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,240
播出這場演出不是網絡的錯
It's not the network's fault for airing it!

529
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,840
是你們的錯
It's you guys!

530
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,810
你們幹嘛要來看這種鬧劇
Why are you watching this stuff?

531
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:28,150
對我們要求太低是你們的錯
It's your fault for demanding so little of us

532
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,280
現在大家都不思進取了
that we settle.

533
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,290
我現在感覺我的臉已經丟光了
I can't feel my face right now,

534
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,590
但是你們知道嗎
but you know what?

535
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,520
我接這個工作的時候就已經知道它是這麼糟糕
I knew exactly what this job was when I took it.

536
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,560
拿這些錢是我的恥辱
Shame on me for taking the money!

537
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,530
捧紅我是你們的恥辱
Shame on you for making me famous!

538
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,330
我們每個人都該感到恥辱
Shame on all of us!

539
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,430
夠了
That's enough.

540
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,600
-喂 -你在想
- Hey... - What are you...?

541
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:47,070
兄弟 我又不是準備打你
I'm not gonna hit you, man.

542
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,700
我不會去打你的
I'm not gonna hit you!

543
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,970

聽著
Listen,

546

Something's not right.

565
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,120
肯定有什麼不對勁的
There's something's not right.

566
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,220

麗貝卡 你做得很好 寶貝

569
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,030

571
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,630
不好意思 現在是怎麼了
I'm sorry, what's happening?

572
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:51,630
我要給她剖腹產

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,950
你好
Hi.

588
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:29,350
我是貝絲 失禮了 我是貝絲
I'm Beth. I'm sorry. I'm Beth.

589
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:31,020
-很高興見到你 貝絲 -嗯
- It's a pleasure meeting you, Beth. - Mm.

590
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,020
你褲子破了個洞
You have a hole in your pants.

591
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,060
安妮
Annie!

592
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,690
噢 沒事 確實是這樣
Oh, that's okay. I actually do.

593
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:38,030
現在年輕人不都流行這麼穿嗎
Hey, isn't that what the kids do to be cool?

594
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,130
在褲子上剪洞
They put holes in their pants,

595
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,870
-對吧 -但不是那樣的洞
- right? - Not like that.

596
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,540
好吧 我還以為我很潮呢
Well, here I was, thought I was being cool.

597
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:47,900
等等 那這樣呢 這樣酷嗎
Wait, what if I do this? Yo, what's going...

598
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,440
不
No.

599
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,710
哎呀呀 你肯定是泰絲吧
My, my, my, you must be Tess.

600
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:55,180
-是的 -我聽說你踢足球呀
- Yes. - I hear you play soccer...

601
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,610
我應該提前打給你的
I should have called.

602
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,010
我不知道要怎麼說出口
I didn't know how to say it out loud.

603
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,680
-所以你就直接這樣 -我
- So, you just... - I...

604
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,350
我沒法解釋 寶貝
I have no explanation, baby.

605
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,720
我想對這個男人說的話
Like, everything I want to say

606
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,020
或者想做的事 都和我所做的相反
or do around this man, I do the opposite.

607
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,090
這就像一個糟糕的情景喜劇
It's like a bad sitcom.

608
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,060
就像《奶爸》或者
It's like an episode of The Man-ny

609
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:11,190
《怎麼了》中的一集
or What's Happening!!

610
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:16,800
他把我遺棄在消防局裏 而我邀請他來我們家
He left me at a fire station and I invited him into our home.

611
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,940
我的天啊 寶貝 你快崩潰了吧
Oh, my God, baby, you're cracking up.

612
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,070
爸爸？
Daddy?

613
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,310
怎麼了
What's happening?

614
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:28,540
怎麼了
What's happening?

615
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,650
-你在開玩笑 -不是
- You're not serious. - I am.

616
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,750
等等 你說的是莎莉·菲爾德
Wait, Sally Field?

617
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,050
-是啊我對莎莉·菲爾德 -嗯

618

- for Sally Field. Sue me. - She's, like, 60.

619
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,720
六十花甲正火辣 你不知道嗎
60 is the new sexy. You didn't know that?

620
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,090
-嗯 -等到她七十歲的時候 天啊
- Mm-mm. - Mm. And when she turns 70...

621
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,700
聽著
Look out,

622
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,400
莎莉會在她的七十歲達到人生巔峰
Sally is gonna peak in her 70s.

623
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,670
-嗯嗯 -我向你保證
-Mm-hmm. - I promise you.

624
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,170
-好的 -給您們上點甜品 有興趣嗎
- Yeah... - Can I interest you in dessert?

625
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,600
-不用了謝謝 -好的
- Oh, no thanks. - Yes!

626
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,610

627
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,740
-不好 -好
- No. - Yes.

628
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:00,770
-不好 -好
- No! - Yes.

629
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:01,880
他剛剛在問
He was just asking

630
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:03,080
他給我們上點甜品的話 我們有沒有興趣
If he could interest us in dessert.

631
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,410
如果他給我們上甜品的話 我當然會很有興趣
I am saying that he can.

632
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:06,550
我對甜品非常有興趣
I am very interested in dessert.

633
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,580
我徹底著迷於甜品
I am utterly fascinated by dessert.

634
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,380
甜品是我的人生追求
Dessert is my life's work.

635
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,550
所以
So...

636
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,920

-謝謝你 -謝謝你們
- Thank you. - Thank you.

638
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:17,560
我一般不愛吃意大利燴飯
I don't normally like risotto,

639
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:20,430
但如果你把它做成球狀 油炸一下
but if you put it in a ball form, and-and deep fry it,

640
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,760
我大概能吃一千個
I can eat, like, a thousand of them.

641
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,730
托比 今天晚上我很開心
I had a really nice time tonight, Toby.

642
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:26,800
-謝謝你 -嗯

644
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,100
怎麼了
What, that's it?

645
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,640
你什麼意思
What do you mean?

646
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:34,370
你不打算邀請我進來
I mean, you're not gonna invite me in for a...

647
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:36,740
小酌一杯
a nightcap or...

648
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,740
或者給我打個飛機什麼的
a handy or something?

649
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,950
-你真有意思 -沒錯

謝謝你
Thank you.

651
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,950
今天晚上我也很開心
I did have a really nice time tonight.

652
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,000
好吧 你可以進來喝杯水
Okay. You can come inside for a water.

653
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,500
-好的 -就一杯水
- All right. - A water.

654
00:29:58,530 --> 00:29:59,830
嗯哼
Uh-huh.

655
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,070
我們已經喝了快四兩酒了
We have already had our six ounces of wine.

656
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,100
我知道
I know.

657
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,100
每四兩酒等於150卡路里
150 calories per six ounce.

658
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,640
-哦 -嗯
- Ooh. - Yeah.

659
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,410
你一直數著卡路里的樣子
You keep counting calories,

660
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,240
讓我很欲罷不能
and you're gonna really turn me on.

661
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,280
-是吧 -嗯
- Yeah. - Hmm.

662
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,580
你想知道一根香腸
You want to know how many, uh,

663
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,680
含有多少卡路里嗎
calories are in a sausage?

664
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,150
這種行為合法的嗎
Is... but is it even legal?

665
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,320
不 在這個國家不合法
No. Not in this country.

666
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,060
你想那什麼嗎
Do you want to fool around?

667
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,360
我不想
I don't.

668
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:26,890
-哦 -呃
- Ah. - Uh...

669
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,860
-好吧 -不是 我
- Okay. - No, I...

670
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,060
不 我想
No, I-I do.

671
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,400
只是很長時間以來
It's just been a long time

672
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,070
都沒有人問我這個問題了
since this has even been an option.

673
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,210
我懂的 我懂
Hey. I know, I know.

674
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,740
不 你不明白
Um, you don't.

675
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,180
我三十六歲了
I am 36.

676
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:49,480
我的
And, um...

677
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,720
身體
this...

678
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:55,090
已經不太有觀賞價值了
...is not a very pretty picture.

679
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,320
沒關係的
It's okay.

680
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,590
-不 我 -沒關係的
- No, it's... - Hey, it's okay.

681
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:02,230
嘿
Hey!

682
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,260
凱文 你他媽怎麼
Kevin, what the hell?

683
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,400
你為什麼不接電話
Why don't you answer your phone?

684
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,300
呃
Uh...

685
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,000
-我剛才在約會 -對 你好
- I was on a date. - Yeah, hi.

686
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:09,140
哦
Oh...

687
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:11,300
這就是你在胖子課上認識的那個有趣的胖子嗎
This is... this is the funny fat guy from fat class?

688
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,910
-你好 -對
- Hi. - Uh, yeah,

689
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,740
我叫托比 那叫互助小組 不叫胖子課
it's Toby, and it's a support group, but yeah.

690
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,610
哦天哪 等等 你就是那個奶爸嗎
Holy... Wait, are you the Man-ny?

691
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,680
沒錯 我就是那個奶爸
Yes, I am, Toby.

692
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,650
我曾經是
I... I was.

693
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,780
-怎麼了 -你沒看手機嗎
- Wait, what? - You didn't check

694
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,520
也沒看推特 臉書什麼的
your phone, Twitter, Facebook, nothing?

695
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,750
-為什麼 怎麼了 -你應該看看的
- Why? Wha...? - Well, you should.

696
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:27,020
-因為 -發生了什麼
- Becau... - Okay, what is hap...

697
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:28,550
-怎麼回事 -我想讓你
What is happening? I want you to know

698
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,120
為我感到驕傲 好嗎
you would've been proud of me, okay?

699
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,960
我就是藝術界正義的化身
I was the picture of artistic integrity.

700
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,060
我們能拍一張你不穿上衣的嗎
Could we do one without your shirt on?

701
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,700
好萊塢今天的大新聞 當然就是
Well, the big news in Hollywood today is, of course,

702
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:42,240
奶爸在錄製現場發飆
the Man-ny's on-set meltdown.

703
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:44,100
好好思考一下
Think about this, I'm like, you know,

704
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,910
這個節目這麼糟糕
it's actually not the writer's fault

705
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,140
其實並不是編劇的錯
that this show is so awful.

706
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:53,750
天哪 我還挺同情艾倫·錫克的
Wow. I actually kind of feel bad for Alan Thicke.

707
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,420
是啊
Yeah.

708
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,890
麗貝卡的生命體征良好
Rebecca's vitals are good.

709
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,960
她還要再睡一會
She's gonna be asleep for a little while,

710
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,660
不過她撐過來了 我們會一直密切監測她的
but she's doing fine. We're monitoring her closely.

711
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,630
好的
Okay.

712
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,770
傑克 我們沒能保住第三個寶寶
We lost the third baby, Jack.

713
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,540
我非常抱歉
I'm-I'm very sorry.

714
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,410
第二個
The, uh...

715
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,240
第二個寶寶是個健康的女孩兒
second baby is a girl, very strong.

716
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,510
第三個寶寶是個男孩兒
The third baby was a little boy,

717
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:30,050
但是臍帶纏著他 讓他無法呼吸
but the, uh, umbilical cord was cutting off his oxygen.

718
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,650
他在出生之前就夭折了 這是無力回天的事了
He was stillborn. Nothing anybody could've done.

719
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:39,560
我很抱歉 我現在大腦一片空白
I'm sorry, I'm... I'm not processing anything.

720
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,290
我的妻子呢
My wife?

721
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:42,630
她很好
Is fine.

722
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,570
她一會兒就醒了
And she'll be awake pretty soon.

723
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,970
傑克 你有兩個漂亮 健康的孩子
You have two beautiful, healthy children, Jack.

724
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,970
一個男孩兒 一個女孩兒
Boy and a girl.

725
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,640
但我們確實沒能保住第三個孩子
But we did lose the third child.

726
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,790
我的妻子需要我
I need to be with my wife.

727
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,990
你一會兒就能去陪她
And you will be.

728
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,990
但她現在需要睡一會
But she needs to sleep now.

729
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,800
你很快就能見到她 你先坐下
But soon. You just sit down.

730
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,360
坐一會
Sit. Sit.

731
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,840
你介意我陪你坐一會兒嗎
Okay if I keep you company a second?

732
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,610
你坐吧
Yeah.

733
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,720
你介意我
Okay if I...

734
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:40,250
試著說些人生道理嗎
try and say something meaningful?

735
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,720
你說吧
Yeah.

736
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,930
去年我的老伴去世了
I lost my wife last year.

737
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,490
癌癥
Cancer.

738
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:52,730
這就是為什麼我一大把年紀了 還在拚命工作
That's the reason I still work so much at my age.

739
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:56,100
想要消磨時間
Just... trying to pass the time.

740
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,770
我們走過了五十三年的婚姻
We were married 53 years.

741
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:07,280
養育了五個孩子 十一個孫子孫女
Five children, 11 grandkids.

742
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:13,650
但我們的第一個孩子在接生的時候夭折了
But we lost our very first child during the delivery.

743
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:18,960
說實話 這就是我專攻婦產科的理由
The reason I went into this field, truth be told...

744
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:24,430
五十年來我接生過的孩子
...I have spent five decades delivering babies.

745
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:26,730
數不勝數
More babies than I can count.

746
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:33,170
但沒有一天
But there is not a single day that goes by

747
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:37,110
我不在想念我失去的那個孩子
that I don't think of the child I lost.

748
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:39,980
如今我已經一把年紀了
And I'm an old man now.

749
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:50,590
我認為正是因為我失去的那個孩子
I like to think that because of the child that I lost,

750
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:53,130
正是因為他送我
because of the path that...

751
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,560
走上這條路
that he sent me on,

752
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,360
才使我得以挽救更多的小生命
that I have saved countless other babies.

753
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,930
是啊
Yeah.

754
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,910
我認為有一天
I like to think that maybe one day

755
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,840
在你像我一樣蒼老的時候
you'll be an old man like me...

756
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,110
你也會和一個年輕人這樣喋喋不休
...talking a younger man's ear off, explaining to him

757
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,050
告訴他
how you...

758
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:22,220
如何把生活贈與你最酸澀的一顆檸檬
took the sourest lemon that life has to offer...

759
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:25,530
釀成一杯甜美的檸檬汁
and turned it into something resembling lemonade.

760
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:30,430
如果你能做到這個 那你從醫院帶回家的
If you can do that, then you will still be...

761
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:33,770
依然是三個孩子
taking three babies home from this hospital.

762
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,770
只是
Just...

763
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,370
不是以設想的方式
maybe not the way you planned.

764
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:46,080
我不知道這算很有意義還是老生常談
I don't know if that was meaningful or senile,

765
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,880
但我覺得應該告訴你這些
but I thought it ought to be said.

766
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:55,760
你妻子還要再睡一會
Your wife'll still be asleep for a little while.

767
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,630
去看看你的孩子吧
Go see your babies.

768
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,800
他們等不及要見爸爸了
They're excited to meet their father.

769
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,570
我認為他們有個好爸爸
I think maybe they got a good one.

770
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,170
不好意思 我得先把女兒們哄睡著
Sorry. Just had to put the girls down.

771
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,170
這些人 他們是你的
These people, they're your...

772
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,660
是我的父母
My parents.

773
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,870
我的養父母
Well, my adopted.

774
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,490
他們就是我的父母
They're my parents.

775
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,380
從你一出生他們就是你的父母嗎
You've been with them your whole life?

776
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:36,350
從始至終
From the start.

777
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:39,050
一位消防員找到我
A fireman found me.

778
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:42,720
他送我去了醫院 我的父母也在那兒
He took me to the hospital, and they were there.

779
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,990
他們說收養我是命運使然
They said it felt meant to be.

780
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:48,760
可以說是我的幸運吧
Just one of those lucky breaks, I guess.

781
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:52,160
消防局
A fire station.

782
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,930
天哪 你的父母真了不起
Gee, what a thing to have done.

783
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,740
-我該走了 -或許你
I should get going. Maybe we could have you by

784
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:00,410
-每隔一段時間能 -不 我覺得沒必要
- every once... - No, I don't think that's necessary.

785
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,010
-不要覺得有壓力 -隻是我
- It's no pressure. I just... - It's just that

786
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,380
我
I'm...

787
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,460
我快死了
I'm dying, is all.

788
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,320
你生病了嗎
You're sick?

789
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,720
快死了 不是病了
Dying, not sick.

790
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:12,000
我幾個月前就生病了
Sick was months ago.

791
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:15,140
幸運的是 我的生命就要走到盡頭了
I'm toward the end, fortunately.

792
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:20,970
我不知道說什麼好
Uh... I don't know what to say.

793
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,390
什麼都不需要說
No, there's nothing to be said.

794
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:27,230
你讓我見到他們
It was a kindness you've shown me,

795
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:29,840
就是對我最大的善意了
letting me meet them.

796
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:36,090
你的父親一定非常為你驕傲
Your dad must've been very proud of you.

797
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:03,870
我不敢相信我在喝著這些卡路里
I cannot believe that I'm drinking these calories.

798
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:06,610
鑒於我剛才親手斷送了自己的前程
Since I just torpedoed my career,

799
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,050
我覺得你可以
I think you can afford an extra,

800
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,580
再喝個一百八十卡路里什麼的
you know, 100 calories or whatever.

801
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:11,350
-一百五十 -一百五十
- 150. - It's 150.

802
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:18,560
如果我並不比《奶爸》上的那個自己強呢
What if I'm not better than The Man-ny?

803
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:22,460
如果我最好的工作就是《奶爸》呢
What if I am exactly "Man-ny good"?

804
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,600
我不知道我還能做什麼
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

805
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,670
百老匯演員
Broadway.

806
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,800
我不會唱歌
Can't sing.

807
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,700
演AV
Porn.

808
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,560
哦 可以吧
Yeah, maybe.

809
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,740
我還得再喝點兒
I'm gonna get some more of this red.

810
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,550
我麻煩大了
I'm in so much trouble.

811
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:50,550
我完了
I am screwed.

812
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:52,920
你聽著 凱文
Listen, okay, Kevin...

813
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:04,130
你記得爸爸原來說的嗎
Do you remember what Dad used to say?

814
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:07,340
不好的事情發生的時候
When something crappy would happen to us?

815
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:11,680
我們感到沮喪
Whenever we'd get down,

816
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,760
一切都不如所願的時候
whenever we felt like life wasn't going our way?

817
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:17,910
哪一個是你的孩子
Which one's yours?

818
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:20,250
嗯 那兩個
Um... those two.

819
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,100
祝賀你 雙胞胎
Congrats! Twins.

820
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,150
天哪
Wow.

821
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:26,390
你呢 哪一個是你的孩子
How about you? Which one's yours?

822
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,090
其實沒有一個是我的孩子
None of 'em, actually.

823
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:30,390
挺操蛋的
Strangest damn thing.

824
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:32,160
有人把一個新生兒遺棄在我的消防站了
Someone left a newborn at my fire station.

825
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,300
我不知道應該怎麼辦 就把他帶到這兒了
I didn't know what to do, so I brought him here.

826
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:44,910
來一根
Smoke?

827
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,840
不了 謝謝你
No. Thank you.

828
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:56,100
生活確實挺操蛋的
Life's strange.

829
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,920
不過祝賀你
Congratulations.

830
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,420
謝謝你
Thank you.

831
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:18,280
來吧 凱文
Come on, Kev.

832
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:19,810
你記得的
You remember.

833
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,080
他當時怎麼說的
What did he say?

834
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:22,650
關於那些檸檬的話
About the lemons?

835
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,150
嗯
Hmm?

836
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,420
「你總會有辦法
"There's no lemon

837
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:27,480
可以把一顆酸澀的檸檬
"...so sour...

838
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,490
釀成一杯甜美的檸檬汁」
...that you can't make something resembling lemonade."

839
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,700
太好了 終於親到你了
Good. Now that's out of the way.

840
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:58,490
