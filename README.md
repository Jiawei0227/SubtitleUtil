# Subtitle Transfer

## Intro
It is a small python program to **remove Chinese or English** characters in your subtitle file

When I was watching *This is us* on my computer. I hate the Chinese subtitle mixed with English subtitle.

Therefore, this python program came to mind.

## Usage

```
python SubtitleTransfer.py [YOUR SUBTITLE FILE PATH] [TYPE]
```
> - TYPE: The type that you want to delete from your subtitle.
> - [Chinese] [English] are available only
> - *.ass* and *.srt* are available only

It will create a new file in your old path with the new postfix.

## Encoding

The encoding of your subtitle will be automatically detected.
