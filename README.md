# Subtitle Transfer
It is a small python program to remove Chinese characters in subtitle

When I was watching *This is us* on my computer. I hate the Chinese subtitle mixed with English subtitle.

Therefore, this python program came to mind.

# usage

python SubtitleTransfer.py [YOUR SUBTITLE FILE PATH] [TYPE]

> TYPE: [Chinese] only now

It will create a new file in your old path with the new postfix.
